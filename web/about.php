<h1>About Link Scrapbook</h1>

<p>The situation is commonplace. You come across interesting articles, podcasts, tv-shows or e-books online without having the time to read or listen to them. Perhaps you add links to your phone or computerâ€™s bookmarks, perhaps not.  </p>
    
<p>Still, you might forget to return to the content later. Even if you would, it is laborious and time-consuming to keep all the interesting links well-organized in one place on your smartphone or laptop. </p>

<p>That is why we designed Link Scrapbook, a web-based service, which allows users to assemble links for articles and store them in neatly in one place. As a user, you are able to organize, tag and describe the links as you wish.</p>


<h3>Why do I need yet another service to use?</h3>
